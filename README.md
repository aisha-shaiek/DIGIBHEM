DIGITAL CALCI
I built a  miniproject of Digital Calculator with some advanced features like trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential functions along with finding the factorial of a given number, finding squares and square root of a given number.
This project includes HTML, CSS and JS code as seperate files inorder to understood the code easily without any confusion.
HTML provides the fundamental structure of the calculator such as creating buttons, input fields, displays area.
CSS gives the appearance to the calculator by providing styling elements like colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, borders.
JS brings the calculator to life by handling functions, user interactions and calculations. It impelemts button clicks, arithmetic operations, displaying accurate results etc.
Result of this code:
